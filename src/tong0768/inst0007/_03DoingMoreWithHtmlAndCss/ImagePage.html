<h1>Mystery Tulip Murderer Strikes</h1>
<p>
    Someone, or something, is killing the tulips of New South
    Haverford, Virginia. Residents of this small town are
    shocked and dismayed by the senseless vandalism that has
    struck their tiny town.
</p>
<p>
    New South Haverford is known for its extravagant displays
    of tulips in the springtime, and a good portion of its
    tourist trade relies on the people who come from as far as
    New Hampshire to see what has been estimated as up to two
    hundred thousand tulips that bloom in April and May.
</p>
<p>
    Or at least the tourists had been flocking to New South
    Haverford until last week, when over the course of three
    days the flower of each and every tulip in the town was
    neatly clipped off while the town slept.
</p>
<p>
    "It started at the south end of town," said Augustin Frouf,
    a retired ladder-maker who has personally planted over five
    hundred pink lily-flowered tulips. "They hit the houses up
    on Elm Street, and moved down into town from there. After
    the second night, we tried keeping guard. We tried bright
    lights, dogs, everything. There was always something that
    pulled us away, and by the time we got back, they were all
    gone."
