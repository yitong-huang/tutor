    <p>When you view a Web page in your browser, you only see text, graphics, and images. Once in a while you hear sounds,
        and you see animation.
        Behind the scenes, it's HTL tags that make it all work and properly display these items in your browser.
        Some of the things that HTML tags do are.</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
        <li>Format headings and paragraph styles</li>
        <li>Create bulleted and numbered lists</li>
        <li>Insert images, Java applets, ActiveX components, and lots of other cool stuff</li>
        <li>Create links that take you to other pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Writing HTML code isn't as tough as you think!
        In spite of the many tools that are available, you can easily write Web pages with a simple text editor.
