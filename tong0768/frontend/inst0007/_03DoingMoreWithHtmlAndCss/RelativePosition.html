    The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat
    from its interest; but if it is judged useful by those inquirers who
    desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation
    of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if
    it does not reflect it, I shall be content.
